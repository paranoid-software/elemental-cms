# elemental CMS

Elemental is a Flask + MongoDB Web CMS intended for use by Developers mainly.

The main idea of this Web CMS is to be able to create and mantain web portals or web applications using a programming IDE like VSCode, PyCharm, etc. and deploy the changes using a self documented command line tool called "elemental-cms".

It relays on MongoDB to store the metadata, pages content, snippets content, dependencies information, and user sessions data.
