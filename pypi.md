# elemental CMS

Elemental is a Flask and MongoDB based CMS intended for developers FIRST.

The main idea of this CMS is to be able to work with the portal pages directly on any programming IDE as editor, and then deploy the changes using a self documented command line tool called "elemental-cms".

It relays on MongoDB to store the pages metadata and HTML content, users sessions, HTML snippets and global dependencies shared by all pages.
